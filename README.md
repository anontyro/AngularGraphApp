# Angular Graph App

Using Angular 1.6 this SPA plugs into Google Charts and is able to display data from the database in a graph form.
The application has a lot of dynamic features such as on the fly resizing and renaming of axis. This was a mock up 
for my internship, the final product was stripped down a bit to remove unecessary features.

When I have time I will look to add aditional features including the ability to make a graph from a new dataset presented 
by the user. Along with an option to input the JSON data and draw a graph from it.
