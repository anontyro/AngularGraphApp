# Angular Graph App

Using Angular 1.6 this SPA plugs into Google Charts and is able to display data from the database in a graph form.
The application has a lot of dynamic features such as on the fly resizing and renaming of axis. This was a mock up 
for my internship, the final product was stripped down a bit to remove unecessary features.

The backend is written in PHP which allows the getting of data from the database, the biggest challenge was creating the
correct JSON array format so that Google Chart would read it correctly.

### Retrospective

I created this webapp quite a while back and it was my first proper webapp and my first time playing with AngularJS I did enjoy it a lot and took a longtime to move myself over to Angular (2/4/5) but I have reimplemented this as an Angular 2 application for my work and it was a much nicer process and one that allowed me to use more components and split it up better. This was an early model and one I have learnt quite a lot from, but I am also glad to have moved onto Angular 2 now.
