# Angular Graph App

Using Angular 1.6 this SPA plugs into Google Charts and is able to display data from the database in a graph form.
The application has a lot of dynamic features such as on the fly resizing and renaming of axis. This was a mock up 
for my internship, the final product was stripped down a bit to remove unecessary features.

The backend is written in PHP which allows the getting of data from the database, the biggest challenge was creating the
correct JSON array format so that Google Chart would read it correctly.

When I have time I will look to add aditional features including the ability to make a graph from a new dataset presented 
by the user. Along with an option to input the JSON data and draw a graph from it. I would also like to add the ability to save 
new datasets into the database, potentially.
